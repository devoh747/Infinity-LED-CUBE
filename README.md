# Infinity-LED-CUBE

The CUBE is heavily inspired by Hypercube made by The Hyperspace Lighting Company: https://hyperspacelight.com/products/hypercube10

Leds I used: WS2812B - 4.8m (144 leds) 
Hardware: ESP32 - I recommend original board as I had a lot of troubleshooting with cheap clone.
The mechanical structure is 3D printed
